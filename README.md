## Why?

Let's first explore the limitation of SwiftUI then explore the awesome features **SwiftUINavigator** provides.

### SwiftUI Limitations

In SwiftUI, there are a lot of limitations:

- [ ] Transition navigations can not be disabled or customized.
- [ ] Can not ignore adding the view to the back stack.
- [ ] No navigation back to root view.
- [ ] Can not navigate to a view using a specific ID.
- [ ] Inconsistent navigation when use `NavigationLinka`, `.sheet` and `.fullScreenCover`
- [ ] Can not navigate programmatically.
- [ ] Customizing the navigation bar is not trivial.

### SwiftUINavigator is awesome

`SwiftUINavigator` has a lot of awesome features. Here's some of these features:

- [X] Custom navigation transitions
- [X] Navigate to a view without adding it to the back stack.
- [X] Direct navigation without links
- [X] Direct navigation with links
- [X] Present sheets without having to declare a sheet modifier.
- [X] Dismiss to previous view.
- [X] Dismiss to root view.
- [X] Dismiss to a specific view using its ID.
- [X] Navigation Bars are built-in the library

### Requirements

- iOS 13+
- Swift 5.3+

## Installation

### üì¶ Swift Package Manager

```
https://github.com/Open-Bytes/SwiftUINavigator.git
```

## :zap: Usage

1. Import `SwiftUINavigator`.

```swift
import SwiftUINavigator
```

2. Declare `NavigatorView` in the root view of the app.

```swift
NavigatorView {
    HomeScreen()
}
```

> `NavigatorView` supports transition animations and other options.
> See [NavigatorView](#navigatorview)

3. Navigate to your destination view:

- Using `NavigatorLink`.

```swift
NavigatorLink(destination: SomeView()) {
    // When this view is clicked, it will trigger 
    // the navigation and show the destination view
    ProductItemView()
}
```

> For more details about`Navigator`, see [NavigatorLink](#navigatorlink)

- Or using `Navigator`

```swift
@EnvironmentObject private var navigator: Navigator

navigator.navigate(SomeView())
```

> For more details about`Navigator`, see [Navigator](#navigator)

4. Dismiss (navigate back) to the previous view
   **_programmatically_** (using `Navigator`) or using a **_link_** (using `DismissLink`).

- Using `NavigatorLink`.

```swift
DismissLink {
    Label("Back", systemImage: "chevron.backward")
            .foregroundColor(.blue)
}
```

- Or using `Navigator`

```swift
navigator.dismiss()
```

> For more details about dismissing,
> see [Dismissing (Navigation Back)](#dismissing-navigation-back)

### NavigatorView

`NavigatorView` is the alternative of SwiftUI NavigationView implementing stack-based navigation with mote control and
flexibility in handling the navigation

#### The public initializers

```swift
public init(
        transition: NavigatorTransitionType = .default,
        easeAnimation: Animation = .easeOut(duration: 0.2),
        @ViewBuilder rootView: () -> Root)

public init(
        navigator: Navigator,
        transition: NavigatorTransitionType = .default,
        easeAnimation: Animation = .easeOut(duration: 0.2),
        @ViewBuilder rootView: () -> Root)
```

As you can see, you can customize the `transition` animation and `easeAnimation`.

```swift
NavigatorView(
        transition: .custom(push: .scale, pop: .slide),
        easeAnimation: .easeInOut) {
    HomeScreen()
}
```

> **Important Note**: the second initializers supports a `Navigator` instance. This is important
> if you need to nest a `NavigatorView` other than the root one. 
> Keep in mind that if you didn't pass the `Navigator` instance, 
> it will work, but it's recommended to pass it for consistent behavior is the whole app.
> In this case, you should pass the instance of `Navigator` using the `EnvironmentObject` as follows:

```swift
@EnvironmentObject private var navigator: Navigator

NavigatorView(navigator: navigator) {
    SomeView()
}
```

> For more details about `NavigatorTransitionType`,
> see [Navigation Transition Types](#navigation-transition-types)

### Navigator

The `Navigator` class is the heart of the library. It's injected to any view as `EnvironmentObject`.

```swift
@EnvironmentObject private var navigator: Navigator
```

You can use `Navigator` directly to navigate programmatically to any view with 3 options

1. Push view (Regular Navigation)

```swift
navigator.navigate(ProductDetailScreen(item: item))
// OR
navigator.navigate(ProductDetailScreen(item: item), type: .push())
```

> You can specify an ID for the pushed view `navigate(SomeView(), type: .push(id: "Detail Screen"))`.
> Later, you can use this ID to navigate back to the view it's belonging to.
> See [Dismissing (Navigation Back)](#dismissing-navigation-back)

> You can ignore adding the view to tha back stack
> `navigate(SomeView(), type: .push(addToBackStack: false))`.
> When you navigate back this view won't be displayed.
> See [Dismissing (Navigation Back)](#dismissing-navigation-back)

2. Present sheet

```swift
navigator.navigate(ProductDetailScreen(item: item), type: .sheet)
```

3. Present full sheet

```swift
navigator.navigate(ProductDetailScreen(item: item), type: .fullSheet)
```

> The navigation types are declared in NavigationType enum.
> See [Navigation Types](#navigation-types)

### NavigatorLink

The alternative of NavigationLink. It's a wrapper of Navigator. When clicked, it will navigate to the destination view
with the specified navigation type.

```swift
NavigatorLink(destination: ProductDetailScreen(item: item)) {
    // When this view is clicked, it will trigger 
    // the navigation and show the destination view
    ProductItemView(item: item)
}
```

### Dismissing (Navigation Back)

You can dismiss the current view:

- Using `NavigatorLink`.

```swift
DismissLink {
    Label("Back", systemImage: "chevron.backward")
            .foregroundColor(.blue)
}
```

- Or using `Navigator`

```swift
navigator.dismiss()
```

> Important Note: You have 4 options in dismissing the current view.
> for more details, see [DismissDestination](#dismissdestination)

### DismissDestination

`DismissDestination` Defines the type of dismiss operation.

```swift
public enum DismissDestination {
    /// Navigate back to the previous view.
    case previous

    /// Navigate back to the root view (i.e. the first view added
    /// to the NavigatorView during the initialization process).
    case root

    /// Navigate back to a view identified by a specific ID.
    case view(withId: String)

    // Dismiss current presented sheet
    case dismissSheet
}
```

You can pass your option to `DismissLink` or `Navigator.dismiss()`

```swift
DismissLink(to: .root) {
    Label("Back", systemImage: "chevron.backward")
            .foregroundColor(.blue)
}

navigator.dismiss(to: .root)
```

### Navigation Bar

Sine we don't use SwiftUI's `NavgationView`, the default navigation bar won't be displayed. To show the navigation bar
you can use the library built-in bars or customize one.

```swift
SomeView()
        .navBar(
                style: .normal,
                leadingView: {
                    SomeView()
                }
        )
```

> `NavBarStyle` supports `normal` and `large navigation bars.

### Transitions

```swift
NavigatorView(transition: .custom(push: .scale, pop: .slide)) {
    SomeView()
}
```

### Navigation Types

This enum defines the supported navigation types

```swift
public enum NavigationType {
    /// Defines the regular navigation type.
    /// id: pass a custom ID to use when navigate back.
    /// addToBackStack: if false, the view won't be added to the back stack 
    /// and won't be displayed when dismissing the view.
    case push(id: String? = nil, addToBackStack: Bool = true)
    /// Present a sheet
    case sheet
    /// Present a full sheet
    @available(iOS 14.0, *)
    case fullSheet
}
```

### Navigation Transition Types

`NavigatorTransitionType` enum defines the supported transition types.

```swift
public enum NavigatorTransitionType {
    /// Transitions won't be animated.
    case none

    /// The default transition if you didn't pass one.
    case `default`

    /// Use a custom transition.
    case custom(push: AnyTransition, pop: AnyTransition)
}
```
